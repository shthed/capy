Single-page color-by-number demo powered by a lightweight React 18 setup served
entirely from static files.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` directly in a browser (an internet connection is required on
first load to fetch the React + Babel runtime from the CDN), or serve the
repository root with any static file server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit <http://localhost:8000> to use the app.
