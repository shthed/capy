## Quick Summary

### Stale Branches ‚Üí DELETE (4 branches)

```bash
git push origin --delete \
  codex/add-local-storage-auto-reload-for-drawings \
  codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-mdptn5 \
  codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html \
  codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html-nzppqn
```

### Open PRs ‚Üí RESOLVE (3 PRs)

| PR | Branch | Files | Strategy |
|----|--------|-------|----------|
| #31 | codex/implement-image-generation-on-game-load | 3 | Merge ChatGPT + autosave |
| #30 | codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-wkhe6x | Multiple | Merge presets + autosave |
| #25 | codex/run-tests-on-app-functions | Multiple | Merge all features |

**Resolution principle:** Keep ALL features (additive merge, no deletions)

## Why These Conflicts Exist

Main branch has evolved with new features:
- ‚ú® Autosave & recovery
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud sync across tabs  
- ü§ñ GitHub Actions workflow

Open PRs were created before these additions and add their own features:
- üé® ChatGPT integration & key manager (PR #31)
- üìä Detail presets & region legend (PR #30)
- üé≠ Palette streamlining & docs (PR #25)

**All features are compatible** - just need to be merged together!

## Resolution Approach

For each PR:

1. **Checkout branch:** `git checkout <branch-name>`
2. **Merge main:** `git merge origin/main`
3. **Resolve conflicts:**
   - Storage constants: Keep both sets
   - Initialization calls: Execute all
   - Features: List everything
   - Documentation: Merge narratives
4. **Commit & push:** `git commit && git push`

## Example (PR #31)

**Before (conflict in index.html):**
```javascript
<<<<<<< HEAD
const OPENAI_KEY_STORAGE = "capycolour.openaiKey";
=======
const AUTOSAVE_STORAGE_KEY = "capy.autosave.v1";
>>>>>>> origin/main
```

**After (resolution):**
```javascript
const OPENAI_KEY_STORAGE = "capycolour.openaiKey";
const AUTOSAVE_STORAGE_KEY = "capy.autosave.v1";
```

Simple! Keep both. This pattern applies throughout.

## Time Required

| Task | Time | Risk |
|------|------|------|
| Delete 4 stale branches | 30s | üü¢ None |
| Resolve PR #31 | 5min | üü° Low |
| Resolve PR #30 | 5min | üü° Low |
| Resolve PR #25 | 5min | üü° Medium |
| Run tests | 2min | - |
| **Total** | **~20 min** | - |

## What Happens After

1. All 3 PRs show "mergeable" ‚úÖ on GitHub
2. PRs can be merged in order: #31 ‚Üí #30 ‚Üí #25
3. Repository has clean branch history
4. No stale branches cluttering the repo
5. All features coexist happily

## Testing

After resolution, verify everything works:

```bash
npm test --silent
```

All Playwright tests should pass.

## FAQ

**Q: Will any code be deleted?**  
A: No! All resolutions are additive (combining features).

**Q: Are the features compatible?**  
A: Yes! They work on different parts of the codebase.

**Q: What if tests fail after resolution?**  
A: Unlikely, but the resolution can be reverted easily.

**Q: Can I automate this?**  
A: The patterns are documented, but manual verification is recommended.

**Q: Which PR should I start with?**  
A: PR #31 (newest, smallest gap from main).
