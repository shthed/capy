# Settings overlay review (reference screenshot)

Notes from the provided settings overlay screenshot to inform Capy’s settings panel refresh:

- **Visibility defaults:** "Show preview on open" and fullscreen entry controls suggest offering clear startup toggles for preview/zoom states.
- **Play style grouping:** Options like tag forgiveness, precise taps, number labels on tap, and swipe-to-fill highlight how input affordances can live together under a concise subheading.
- **Hints and guidance:** Animated hint flashes, active-cell highlight, and glow-on-hover behaviours expose adjustable hint intensity—similar to Capy’s hint animations and preview glows.
- **Look and feel:** A simple dark theme toggle plus adjustable interface size slider reinforce placing comfort settings together and labelling them with immediate context.

These patterns can guide a future pass on Capy’s settings layout: grouping related toggles, exposing hint intensity controls, and keeping comfort options visible without deep menus.
