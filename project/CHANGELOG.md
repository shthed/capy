# Change Log

## 2025-11-26
- Switched the service worker and cache helper to ES modules so GitHub Pages serves them with a supported MIME type.
- Added a lightweight README mirror at `/README/` to keep the in-app Help panel from hitting 404s.

## 2025-11-23
- Clarified Playwright setup/retry expectations in `AGENTS.md` so UI smoke tests run cleanly after browser installs.
- Recorded the latest automated coverage (`npm test --silent`) and artifact expectations for this update.
