# Commit review — 2024-05-26

## Summary
- Reviewed the combined start screen and save manager changes shipped in #113.
- Verified the README project links and copy updates introduced in #114.
- Identified follow-up refactor candidates to deduplicate launcher/save rendering logic and reduce DOM complexity.

## Findings

### Start screen & save manager consolidation (#113)
- The onboarding hint now embeds a unified "Start a game" surface that lists the default Capybara Springs puzzle, manual saves, and the save manager actions in a single focusable panel.【F:index.html†L1467-L1516】
- Save entries populate both the launch list and the management table via `refreshSaveList`, keeping the launcher and controls in sync as saves change.【F:index.html†L7890-L7949】
- Selecting a game from the list routes either to the default puzzle loader or the targeted save entry, while the Saves command now routes back into the same sheet and scrolls to the management section for continuity.【F:index.html†L3251-L3295】
- Start sheet focus management, optional scrolling to the saves section, and close-button visibility respond to whether the player has an active puzzle or stored saves, preserving accessibility and reducing stray controls.【F:index.html†L3926-L3949】【F:index.html†L4256-L4266】

### README project links (#114)
- README now opens with direct links to the production app, branch previews, and the repository, making the reference destinations obvious for reviewers.【F:README.md†L1-L32】
- Feature documentation calls out the combined start screen and save manager so the written guidance matches the new onboarding experience.【F:README.md†L46-L120】

## Recommendations
- Extract a shared helper for formatting save metadata (title, progress counts, timestamp) so `refreshGameSelection` and `refreshSaveList` stay in sync without duplicating string assembly and DOM attribute logic.【F:index.html†L7892-L7919】【F:index.html†L7933-L7949】
- Consider rendering save entries through a single template routine rather than mixing `createElement` and `innerHTML` snippets; this would centralize button wiring and make it easier to add future fields in one place.【F:index.html†L7892-L7949】
- Monitor real-world usage to ensure the unified launcher remains intuitive for returning players.

## Verification
- `npm test --silent` (reports the suite is temporarily disabled; manual smoke passes remain necessary).
