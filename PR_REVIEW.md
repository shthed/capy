# PR Review Notes

## Summary
- Walked through the Playwright `ui-review` harness to confirm it waits for palette buttons and numbered paths before capturing the scene, and that the assertions fail when either count is zero.
- Spot-checked the segmented `art/capybara-forest.svg` to ensure the metadata (`data-cell-id`, palette attributes, and `<title>` nodes) still line up with the written specification after the restructuring.
- Verified the documentation updates in `docs/svg-art-file-spec.md` and `ui-review.md` explain the new screenshot workflow so contributors can reproduce the checks locally.

## Capycolour branch change overview
- Rebranded the single-page app to **Capycolour**, layering in a prompt bar that talks to ChatGPT, an adaptive command rail, and a footer telemetry tray with progress, status stream, and generator metadata so players and tests can follow each import step.
- Added a persistent in-app OpenAI key manager, extended debug logging across generation phases, and hid advanced generator controls/status UI on mobile via accessibility-aware helpers to keep portrait layouts focused on the canvas.
- Landed a dedicated mocked ChatGPT Playwright spec plus selector updates in the UI smoke suite, introduced npm helpers for the new tests, and scripted `npm run git:update` via `tools/git-update.js` for deterministic sync checks.
- Expanded documentation with a revamped README, a development quality review, and a testing feedback loop guide; refreshed existing docs to cover telemetry, logging expectations, and the mobile layout adjustments.
- Brought in the GitHub Pages deployment workflow so the branch stays aligned with `main`'s static hosting pipeline.

## Codex Bot Feedback
- The Codex bot called out that the harness should explicitly fail when no palette buttons render. The assertions at the end of `tests/ui-review.spec.js` now cover both palette and cell counts, and the test also waits for the selectors so the screenshot only runs after a real render.
- It also reminded us to keep the screenshot artifacts discoverable. The harness writes both the PNG and JSON summary into `artifacts/ui-review/`, matching the docs so reviewers know where to look.

## Verdict
Approved. All blocking feedback has been addressed and the visual regression harness behaves as expected.

## Latest Sync Verification
- Ran `git fetch --all --prune` followed by `npm run git:update` to confirm the branch is aligned; no remote updates were available and `git status` reported a clean `work` branch.
- With the tree clean and no merge conflicts present, the PR remains ready for review without additional rebasing.

## Pre-merge readiness check (2025-02-15)
- Re-ran `npm run git:update` and `git status -sb` to verify no new upstream commits or local edits appeared while preparing to merge.
- Searched for conflict markers with `rg "<<<<<<<"` (excluding the generated copies under `node_modules/`) and confirmed the source tree is marker-free.
- Executed the full Playwright suite via `npm test --silent`; all seven specs passed, confirming the prompt flow, telemetry tray, and responsive behaviours remain stable prior to merge.

## Merge conflict review
- Re-ran `npm run git:update` and inspected `git status -sb`; no staged or unstaged edits surfaced beyond this review update.
- Searched the repository for merge markers to confirm none are present, keeping the branch conflict-free ahead of the next rebase or merge.
