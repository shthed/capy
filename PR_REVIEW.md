# PR Review Notes

## Summary
- Walked through the Node-based smoke harness (`tools/run-basic-tests.js`) to confirm it guards the root mount point, public generator API, and handbook guidance with failing assertions when any element goes missing.
- Spot-checked the segmented `art/capybara-forest.svg` to ensure the metadata (`data-cell-id`, palette attributes, and `<title>` nodes) still line up with the written specification after the restructuring.
- Verified the documentation updates in `docs/svg-art-file-spec.md` and `ui-review.md` explain the manual verification workflow so contributors can reproduce the checks locally.

## Codex Bot Feedback
- The Codex bot requested hard failures when core DOM scaffolding disappears. The Node harness now asserts on the mount point, `window.capyGenerator` assignment, and the handbook's test documentation so regressions fail fast.
- It also reminded us to keep regression guidance front-and-center. The harness reads `AGENTS.md` to ensure the Test Results section stays present, matching the docs so reviewers know where to look for the latest run.

## Verdict
Approved. All blocking feedback has been addressed and the smoke harness behaves as expected.
