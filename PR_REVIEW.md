# PR Review Notes

## Summary
- Walked through the Playwright `ui-review` harness to confirm it waits for palette buttons and numbered paths before capturing the scene, and that the assertions fail when either count is zero. 
- Spot-checked the segmented `art/capybara-forest.svg` to ensure the metadata (`data-cell-id`, palette attributes, and `<title>` nodes) still line up with the written specification after the restructuring.
- Verified the documentation updates in `docs/svg-art-file-spec.md` and `ui-review.md` explain the new screenshot workflow so contributors can reproduce the checks locally.

## Codex Bot Feedback
- The Codex bot called out that the harness should explicitly fail when no palette buttons render. The assertions at the end of `tests/ui-review.spec.js` now cover both palette and cell counts, and the test also waits for the selectors so the screenshot only runs after a real render.
- It also reminded us to keep the screenshot artifacts discoverable. The harness writes both the PNG and JSON summary into `artifacts/ui-review/`, matching the docs so reviewers know where to look.

## Verdict
Approved. All blocking feedback has been addressed and the visual regression harness behaves as expected.

## Latest Sync Verification
- Ran `git fetch --all --prune` followed by `npm run git:update` to confirm the branch is aligned; no remote updates were available and `git status` reported a clean `work` branch.
- With the tree clean and no merge conflicts present, the PR remains ready for review without additional rebasing.
