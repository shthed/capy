# PR Review Notes

## Summary
- Sampled the code paths that calculate region centroids and identified repeated DOM measurements that could be cached.
- Confirmed that `estimatePathArea` was using a polygon-only approximation even when a browser measurement API was available.

## Actions Taken
- Cache bounding boxes, sampled areas, and interior points per SVG path so repeated renders avoid unnecessary DOM work.
- Teach `estimatePathArea` to reuse the precise sampling-based area computation before falling back to the polygon heuristic.

## Remaining Risks
- Cached entries are keyed by the raw `d` attribute; if future tooling normalizes whitespace these lookups will remain valid, but deliberate mutations at runtime should call the relevant cache `.clear()` helpers if introduced.
- The polygon fallback still ignores bezier curvature. If `Path2D` is ever unavailable in a target browser, consider swapping in a dedicated parser.
