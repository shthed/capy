# Branch Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the analysis and actions needed to cleanup old branches and resolve merge conflicts in the shthed/capy repository.

## Current State Analysis

### Branch Inventory
- **Total remote branches:** 9
- **Active branches with open PRs:** 4
- **Stale branches (merged, no open PR):** 4  
- **Main branch:** `main` (at commit `a1e912e`)

### Open PRs Status

| PR # | Title | Branch | Mergeable | Conflicts |
|------|-------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| 32 | cleanup old branches and resolve merge conflicts | copilot/fix-3af9ce9e-98e2-419e-961e-96b4796d3eab | ✅ Yes | None |
| 31 | Add in-app ChatGPT key manager | codex/implement-image-generation-on-game-load | ❌ No | 3 files |
| 30 | Add sample detail presets | codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-wkhe6x | ❌ No | Multiple files |
| 25 | Streamline palette swatches | codex/run-tests-on-app-functions | ❌ No | Multiple files |

### Stale Branches Identified

These branches were already merged and have no open PRs:

1. **codex/add-local-storage-auto-reload-for-drawings**
   - Merged in PR #29
   - Safe to delete

2. **codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-mdptn5**
   - Merged in PR #26
   - Safe to delete

3. **codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html**

   - Safe to delete

4. **codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html-nzppqn**
   - Merged in PR #28
   - Safe to delete

## Conflict Analysis

### Root Cause

All three conflicting PRs (##25, #30, #31) are based on older versions of main that predate recent feature additions:

- **PR #31 & #30 base:** `7ecd437` - Before autosave/cloud sync was added
- **PR #25 base:** `f7af674` - Even older, before multiple features
- **Current main:** `a1e912e` - Includes autosave, cloud sync, and GitHub Actions workflow

### Conflict Types

The conflicts arise from parallel feature development:

**PR #31 (ChatGPT Manager) vs Main (Autosave):**
- Storage constants: PR adds ChatGPT keys, main adds autosave keys → Keep both
- Initialization: PR adds generator setup, main adds settings application → Call both
- Boot sequence: PR adds prompt handling, main adds autosave restoration → Merge both

**Similar patterns in PRs #30 and #25**

## Deliverables

### 1. Documentation Created

- **MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md** - Detailed resolution guide for each PR
  - File-by-file conflict analysis
  - Code snippets showing how to merge changes
  - Automated resolution script template
  
- **BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md** - This document
  - Complete analysis of repository state
  - Action items for maintainers

### 2. Actions Required (Maintainer Access Needed)

Due to authentication limitations, the following actions require a repository maintainer:

#### Resolve PR Conflicts

```bash
# PR #31
git checkout codex/implement-image-generation-on-game-load
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts per MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md
git commit && git push

# PR #30  
git checkout codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-wkhe6x
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts (similar strategy)
git commit && git push

# PR #25
git checkout codex/run-tests-on-app-functions
git merge main
# Resolve conflicts (similar strategy)
git commit && git push
```

#### Delete Stale Branches

```bash
git push origin --delete \
  codex/add-local-storage-auto-reload-for-drawings \
  codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-mdptn5 \
  codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html \
  codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html-nzppqn
```

## Testing Requirements

After resolving conflicts, run the full test suite:

```bash
npm test --silent
```

Expected outcome: All Playwright tests pass, confirming merged features work together.

## Timeline & Priority

### High Priority
- Resolve PR #31 conflicts (newest, most active)
- Delete 4 stale branches (low risk, high cleanup value)

### Medium Priority  
- Resolve PR #30 conflicts
- Resolve PR #25 conflicts (oldest PR, may need additional review)

## Notes

- All conflict resolutions preserve both feature sets (additive merges)
- No code deletions required - features complement each other
- The resolution strategies are well-documented and can be applied systematically
- After cleanup, repository will have cleaner branch history and all PRs will be mergeable

## Verification Checklist

After maintainer actions:

- [ ] PR #31 shows "mergeable" on GitHub
- [ ] PR #30 shows "mergeable" on GitHub  
- [ ] PR #25 shows "mergeable" on GitHub
- [ ] 4 stale branches deleted from remote
- [ ] `npm test --silent` passes
- [ ] No regression in existing features
