# Merge Conflict Report: PR #96 (Tap Responsiveness) into Main

## Overview
Merging PR #96 (`codex/improve-tap-response-performance-ka9nao`) into `main` raised a
conflict in `index.html`. The PR branch contained enhanced functionality for handling
already-filled regions, while the main branch had a simpler implementation.

## Context
PR #96 included three commits:
1. `b12ca08` - Improve tap responsiveness on puzzle canvas
2. `873f5a6` - Speed up hint flashes and highlight target color  
3. `803157b` - Flash remaining colour regions when tapping filled areas

The conflict arose because PR #95 (which was already merged into main) implemented a basic
version of the tap responsiveness feature, while PR #96 built upon that with additional
enhancements.

## Conflict Location
The disagreement was in the `attemptFillRegion` function (around line 3264) when handling
already-filled regions:

**Main branch approach:**
```javascript
if (state.filled.has(regionId)) {
  logDebug(`Region ${region.id} already filled; ignoring ${label}`);
  return "ignored";
}
```

**PR #96 branch approach:**
```javascript
if (state.filled.has(regionId)) {
  const remaining = getRegionsByColor(region.colorId, { includeFilled: false });
  if (remaining.length > 0) {
    flashColorRegions(region.colorId);
    const regionWord = remaining.length === 1 ? "region" : "regions";
    logDebug(
      `Region ${region.id} already filled; flashing ${remaining.length} remaining ${regionWord} for colour #${region.colorId}`
    );
  } else {
    logDebug(`Region ${region.id} already filled; ignoring ${label}`);
  }
  return "already-filled";
}
```

## Resolution
We adopted the PR branch's enhanced implementation because it provides better user
experience:

- When tapping an already-filled region, it now flashes all remaining unfilled regions of
  that same color
- Provides helpful visual feedback to guide users toward incomplete areas
- Returns a more descriptive status ("already-filled" vs "ignored")
- Maintains backward compatibility with the debug logging for cases where no regions remain

This resolution preserves all the enhancements from PR #96 while building upon the
foundation laid by PR #95.

## Dependencies
The resolution relies on these existing functions:
- `getRegionsByColor(colorId, options)` - Filters regions by color
- `flashColorRegions(colorId, options)` - Visual feedback animation
- `logDebug(message)` - Debug logging

All functions were confirmed present in the merged codebase.
