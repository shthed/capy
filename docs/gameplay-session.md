# Gameplay Session Log

## Session Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Objective:** Explore the Capycolour color-by-number experience (including the ChatGPT prompt flow) and validate that gameplay interactions respond as expected when served locally.

## Environment
- Served repository root with `python -m http.server 8000`.
- Accessed the app at <http://localhost:8000/index.html> via an automated Chromium session (Playwright).

## Actions Performed
1. Reloaded the page to confirm the autosave pipeline restored the last
   in-progress puzzle. In a fresh profile with no OpenAI key configured the
   runtime logged a skipped ChatGPT request before loading the ‚ÄúCapycolour
   Springs‚Äù fallback puzzle‚Äîcomplete with the orange-crowned capybara, loyal
   dachshund, waterfall, and mushroom-ring lagoon. Pressed the üêπ command button
   afterwards to force a fresh board and confirm the shortcut still works
   without reopening the hint overlay.
2. Selected the first palette swatch to activate its associated colour and
   watched the matching regions flash for guidance.
3. Dragged the canvas with mouse and touch, pinched to zoom, toggled
   fullscreen, and filled a highlighted region to confirm the viewport recenters
   cleanly at every scale.

## Observations
- Artwork, palette, the prompt bar, and the top-right hint/menu controls
  rendered without errors once the page finished hydrating, and either the
  ChatGPT illustration or bundled sample was playable immediately.
- The top-right command rail now shows icon-only controls (including the
  fullscreen toggle) tucked to the right edge so opening settings or the save
  manager never obscures the artwork.
- Palette selection immediately highlighted the active swatch, flashed every
  matching region (with a celebratory flash once a colour is complete), and kept
  the compact number-only label crisp while remaining counts surfaced via
  tooltip copy.
- Tweaking the background colour control instantly repainted unfinished regions
  and flipped numeral contrast, so a darker backdrop stayed readable while
  painting.
- Painting a cell updated the fill colour inline with the clustered artwork (no
  refresh needed) and click-drag panning, pinch/scroll zoom, plus `+`/`-`
  keyboard shortcuts made it easy to inspect tiny regions. Entering and exiting
  fullscreen (or rotating the device) recentred the canvas automatically.
- The refreshed Help sheet documents every icon command (including the prompt
  bar and fullscreen), reiterates the gesture controls, and streams a live debug
  log so it was easy to verify hints, fills, zooms, sample fallbacks, autosave
  restores, and orientation changes during the session.
- Debug logging now captures ignored clicks (no puzzle, wrong colour, filled
  regions), viewport orientation changes, fullscreen transitions, background
  updates, autosave restore messages, and both the start and completion of
  sample reloads with severity badges that mirror the status tray‚Äîmaking it
  easier to spot warnings versus success events at a glance.
- The footer status tray surfaced each import step‚Äîfile read, image decode,
  k-means clustering, segmentation counts, palette prep, and rolling progress‚Äîon
  a live progress bar, populated a telemetry grid with the active mode/prompt
  plus source/target sizes, palette/region totals, progress percentages, and the
  active pipeline step, and emitted fading notifications so it was obvious where
  the generator was spending time. On the phone-sized run the tray auto-
  collapsed, keeping the palette visible while the Help sheet mirrored the same
  telemetry for deeper dives.
- Rolling autosaves hit local storage on each stroke and immediately mirror to
  any open tabs via the cloud sync channel, so the session resumed intact after
  hard refreshes.
- Overall responsiveness stayed smooth during the brief automation-driven play
  session.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Capture longer playthroughs that cycle through multiple colors to validate completion tracking and autosave.
- Evaluate touch interactions (pinch zoom, drag fill) on a mobile emulator for broader coverage.
