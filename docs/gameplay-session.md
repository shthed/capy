# Gameplay Session Log

## Session Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Objective:** Explore the Capycolour color-by-number experience (including the ChatGPT prompt flow) and validate that gameplay interactions respond as expected when served locally.

## Environment
- Served repository root with `python -m http.server 8000`.
- Accessed the app at <http://localhost:8000/index.html> via an automated Chromium session (Playwright).

## Actions Performed
1. Launched the app with no OpenAI key configured and watched the runtime log a
   skipped ChatGPT request before loading the ‚ÄúCapycolour Springs‚Äù fallback
   puzzle, then pressed the üêπ command button to reload it without reopening the
   hint overlay.
2. Selected the first palette swatch to activate its associated colour and
   watched the matching regions flash for guidance.
3. Dragged the canvas with mouse and touch, pinched to zoom, toggled
   fullscreen, and filled a highlighted region to confirm the viewport recenters
   cleanly at every scale.

## Observations
- Artwork, palette, the prompt bar, and the top-right hint/menu controls rendered without errors once the page finished hydrating, and either the ChatGPT illustration or bundled sample was playable immediately.
- The top-right command rail now shows icon-only controls (including the fullscreen toggle) tucked to the right edge so opening settings or the save manager never obscures the artwork.
- Palette selection immediately highlighted the active swatch, flashed every matching region (with a celebratory flash once a colour is complete), and kept the compact number-only label crisp while remaining counts surfaced via tooltip copy.
- Tweaking the new background colour control instantly repainted unfinished regions and flipped numeral contrast, so a darker backdrop stayed readable while painting.
- Painting a cell updated the fill colour inline with the clustered artwork (no refresh needed) and click-drag panning, pinch/scroll zoom, plus `+`/`-` keyboard shortcuts made it easy to inspect tiny regions. Entering and exiting fullscreen (or rotating the device) recentred the canvas automatically.
- The refreshed Help sheet documents every icon command (including the prompt bar and fullscreen), reiterates the gesture controls, and streams a live debug log so it was easy to verify hints, fills, zooms, sample fallbacks, and orientation changes during the session.
- The new footer status tray surfaced each import step‚Äîfile read, image decode, k-means clustering, segmentation counts, and palette prep‚Äîon a live progress bar, populated a telemetry grid with the active mode/prompt plus source/target sizes and palette/region totals, and emitted fading notifications so it was obvious where the generator was spending time.
- The refreshed Help sheet now includes a ChatGPT access section, making it trivial to paste or clear the OpenAI key without touching DevTools while the debug log confirms every save/clear action and outlines what each severity badge means.
- Debug logging now captures ignored clicks (no puzzle, wrong colour, filled regions), viewport orientation changes, fullscreen transitions, background updates, and both the start and completion of sample reloads with severity badges that mirror the status tray‚Äîmaking it easier to spot warnings versus success events at a glance.
- Overall responsiveness stayed smooth during the brief automation-driven play session.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Capture longer playthroughs that cycle through multiple colors to validate completion tracking and autosave.
- Evaluate touch interactions (pinch zoom, drag fill) on a mobile emulator for broader coverage.
