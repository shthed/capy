# Gameplay Session Log

## Session Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Objective:** Explore the Capy color-by-number experience and validate that gameplay interactions (palette selection and canvas painting) respond as expected when served locally.

## Environment
- Served repository root with `python -m http.server 8000`.
- Accessed the app at <http://localhost:8000/index.html> via an automated Chromium session (Playwright).

## Actions Performed
1. Reloaded the page to confirm the autosave pipeline restored the last
   in-progress puzzle; with no prior data the "Capybara Springs" scene still
   loads automatically in the high detail preset, showcasing the
   orange-crowned capybara, loyal dachshund, waterfall, and mushroom-ring
   lagoon. Pressed the üêπ command button afterwards to force a fresh board and
   confirm the shortcut still works without reopening the hint overlay.
2. Clicked the Low/Medium/High detail chips to confirm each preset updates the
   generator sliders, reloads the sample with the expected ‚âà26/‚âà42/‚âà140 region
   breakdowns, and writes its summary to the debug log.
3. Selected the first palette swatch to activate its associated colour and
   watched the matching regions flash for guidance.
4. Dragged the canvas with mouse and touch, pinched to zoom, toggled
   fullscreen, and filled a highlighted region to confirm the viewport recenters
   cleanly at every scale.

## Observations
- Artwork, palette, and the top-right hint/menu controls rendered without errors once the page finished hydrating, and the bundled sample was already playable before touching any UI.
- The top-right command rail now shows icon-only controls (including the fullscreen toggle) tucked to the right edge so opening settings or the save manager never obscures the artwork.
- Palette selection immediately highlighted the active swatch, flashed every matching region (with a celebratory flash once a colour is complete), and kept the compact number-only label crisp while remaining counts surfaced via tooltip copy.
- Tweaking the background colour control instantly repainted unfinished regions and flipped numeral contrast, and the new interface scale slider resized the command rail and palette without touching puzzle zoom so HUD tweaks no longer require custom CSS.
- The generator's art prompt query now lives inside a collapsed Advanced options panel in Settings, keeping the onboarding hint clean while still letting us document the inspiration alongside saves and exports when needed.
- Painting a cell updated the fill colour inline with the clustered artwork (no refresh needed) and click-drag panning, pinch/scroll zoom, plus `+`/`-` keyboard shortcuts made it easy to inspect tiny regions. Entering and exiting fullscreen (or rotating the device) recentred the canvas automatically.
- Mobile pinch gestures now stay focused on the canvas ‚Äî the viewport meta clamps browser zoom so the interface never scales accidentally while still letting our custom pan/zoom math run.
- The refreshed Help sheet documents every icon command (including fullscreen), reiterates the gesture controls, and streams a live debug log so it was easy to verify hints, fills, zooms, and orientation changes during the session.
- Debug logging now captures ignored clicks (no puzzle, wrong colour, filled
  regions), viewport orientation changes, fullscreen transitions, background
  updates, autosave restore messages, and both the start and completion of
  sample reloads which helped confirm why certain taps were rejected while
  exercising the canvas.
- Detail preset switches add "Loading <preset> detail" entries before the usual
  completion log, and the Settings sheet mirrors the same chips for mid-session
  adjustments, making it easy to trace which configuration produced a given
  palette or region count (‚âà26 for low, ‚âà42 for medium, ‚âà140 for high).
- Rolling autosaves hit local storage on each stroke and immediately mirror to
  any open tabs via the new cloud sync channel, so the session resumed intact
  after hard refreshes.
- Overall responsiveness stayed smooth during the brief automation-driven play session.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Capture longer playthroughs that cycle through multiple colors to validate completion tracking and autosave.
- Evaluate touch interactions (pinch zoom, drag fill) on a mobile emulator for broader coverage.
