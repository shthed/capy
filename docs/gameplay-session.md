# Gameplay Session Log

## Session Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Objective:** Explore the Capy color-by-number experience and validate that gameplay interactions (palette selection and canvas painting) respond as expected when served locally.

## Environment
- Served repository root with `python -m http.server 8000`.
- Accessed the app at <http://localhost:8000/index.html> via an automated Chromium session (Playwright).

## Actions Performed
1. Loaded the default "Capybara in a Forest" scene from the artwork library.
2. Selected the first palette swatch to activate its associated color.
3. Painted an available cell on the SVG canvas to confirm interaction wiring.

## Observations
- Artwork, palette, and progress UI rendered without errors once the page finished hydrating.
- The art-library button stayed pinned to the top-right header rail, matching the UI review coverage expectations even on a narrow viewport.
- Palette selection immediately highlighted the active swatch and kept the tiny in-button label readable without surfacing a "left" badge.
- Painting a cell updated the fill color inline without requiring additional refreshes or focus changes.
- Overall responsiveness stayed smooth during the brief automation-driven play session.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Capture longer playthroughs that cycle through multiple colors to validate progress tracking.
- Evaluate touch interactions (pinch zoom, drag fill) on a mobile emulator for broader coverage.
