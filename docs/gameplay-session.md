# Gameplay Session Log

## Session Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Objective:** Explore the Capy color-by-number experience and validate that gameplay interactions (palette selection and canvas painting) respond as expected when served locally.

## Environment
- Served repository root with `python -m http.server 8000`.
- Accessed the app at <http://localhost:8000/index.html> via an automated Chromium session (Playwright).

## Actions Performed
1. Triggered the **Try the capybara sample** button to generate the bundled
   "Capybara Meadow" scene without importing external art.
2. Selected the first palette swatch to activate its associated color.
3. Painted an available cell on the SVG canvas to confirm interaction wiring.

## Observations
- Artwork, palette, and the top-right hint/menu controls rendered without errors once the page finished hydrating, and the
  sample preview inside the start overlay matched the generated scene.
- The top-right command rail now shows icon-only controls tucked to the right edge so opening settings or the save manager never obscures the artwork.
- Palette selection immediately highlighted the active swatch, flashed every matching region (with a celebratory flash once a colour is complete), and kept the compact number-only label crisp while remaining counts surfaced via tooltip copy.
- Painting a cell updated the fill color inline with the clustered artwork (no refresh needed) and click-drag panning, scroll-wheel zoom, plus `+`/`-` keyboard shortcuts made it easy to inspect tiny regions.
- The refreshed Help sheet documents every icon command, reiterates the gesture controls, and streams a live debug log so it was easy to verify hints, fills, and zoom gestures during the session.
- Debug logging now captures ignored clicks (no puzzle, wrong colour, filled regions), which helped confirm why certain taps were rejected while exercising the canvas.
- Overall responsiveness stayed smooth during the brief automation-driven play session.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Capture longer playthroughs that cycle through multiple colors to validate completion tracking and autosave.
- Evaluate touch interactions (pinch zoom, drag fill) on a mobile emulator for broader coverage.
