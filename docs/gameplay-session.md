# Gameplay Session Log

## Session Overview
- **Date:** 2025-10-04
- **Objective:** Explore the Capy color-by-number experience and validate that gameplay interactions (palette selection and canvas painting) respond as expected when served locally.

## Environment
- Served repository root with `python -m http.server 8000`.
- Accessed the app at <http://localhost:8000/index.html> via an automated Chromium session (Playwright).

## Actions Performed
1. Loaded the default "Capybara Forest Retreat" scene from the artwork library.
2. Selected the first palette swatch to activate its associated color.
3. Painted an available cell on the SVG canvas to confirm interaction wiring.

## Observations
- Artwork, palette, and progress UI rendered without errors once the page finished hydrating.
- The art-library button remained visible on the header rail, matching the UI review coverage expectations.
- Palette selection immediately highlighted the active swatch and revealed the remaining cell count badge.
- Painting a cell updated the fill color inline without requiring additional refreshes or focus changes.
- Overall responsiveness stayed smooth during the brief automation-driven play session.

## Follow-up Ideas
- Capture longer playthroughs that cycle through multiple colors to validate progress tracking.
- Evaluate touch interactions (pinch zoom, drag fill) on a mobile emulator for broader coverage.
