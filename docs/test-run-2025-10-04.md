# Test Run - 2025-10-04

## Overview
- Command: `npm test --silent`
- Environment: containerized Linux runner with Node.js 20 and bundled Playwright deps
- Trigger: Regression verification requested via follow-up review feedback

## Results
The consolidated Playwright UI review suite passed in **58.7 seconds**. The run exercised the following flows and verifications:

| # | Scenario | What it verifies |
| - | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Command rail and generator controls render | Header buttons, hidden generator settings, and onboarding hint layout appear on load. |
| 2 | Sample auto load and reload | Startup autoload pulls the capybara scene, reload buttons respect detail presets, and autosave hand-off works. |
| 3 | Match highlighting & zoom | Hint flashing, zoom in/out buttons, and reset flows keep overlays and progress in sync. |
| 4 | Canvas background customization | Background picker updates the SVG stage and persists colour state. |
| 5 | Pattern completion | Filling the `basic-pattern.svg` fixture drives completion telemetry and autosave updates. |
