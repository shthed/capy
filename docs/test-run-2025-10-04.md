# Test Run - 2025-10-04

## Overview
- Command: `npm test --silent`
- Environment: containerized Linux runner with Node.js 20 and bundled Playwright deps
- Trigger: Regression verification requested via follow-up review feedback

## Results
All Playwright UI review scenarios passed in **1 minute 6 seconds**. Expect.poll
retries surfaced noisier console output while verifying the onboarding reloads, but
the suite still exercises the core onboarding presets, palette and zoom
interactions, background customization, and fixture filling logic so regressions
surface quickly during branch merges.

| # | Scenario | What it verifies |
| - | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Application shell renders | React runtime boots, starter artwork mounts, HUD chrome appears, and help/settings sheets expose expected labels. |
| 2 | Sample presets reload | The Capybara Springs vignette loads automatically, detail presets swap correctly, and debug logs capture each reload (poll waits retried before passing). |
| 3 | Palette feedback & zoom | Selecting colours flashes matching regions, zoom guards stay active, and pointer pan/zoom helpers remain responsive. |
| 4 | Background adjustments | Settings sheet controls update the stage background and persist accessibility-friendly contrast. |
| 5 | Basic fixture completion | The generator API loads the basic test pattern and supports scripted fills until the puzzle finishes. |
