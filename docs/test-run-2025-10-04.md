# Test Run - 2025-10-04

## Overview
- Command: `npm test --silent`
- Environment: containerized Linux runner with Node.js 20 and bundled Playwright deps
- Trigger: Regression verification requested via follow-up review feedback

## Results
All Playwright UI review scenarios passed in **55.3 seconds**. The suite exercises the
core onboarding presets, palette and zoom interactions, background customization, and
fixture filling logic so regressions surface quickly during branch merges.

| # | Scenario | What it verifies |
| - | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Application shell renders | React runtime boots, starter artwork mounts, HUD chrome appears, and help/settings sheets expose expected labels. |
| 2 | Sample presets reload | The Capybara Springs vignette loads automatically, detail presets swap correctly, and debug logs capture each reload. |
| 3 | Palette feedback & zoom | Selecting colours flashes matching regions, zoom guards stay active, and pointer pan/zoom helpers remain responsive. |
| 4 | Background adjustments | Settings sheet controls update the stage background and persist accessibility-friendly contrast. |
| 5 | Basic fixture completion | The generator API loads the basic test pattern and supports scripted fills until the puzzle finishes. |
