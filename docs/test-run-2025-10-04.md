# Test Run - 2025-10-04

## Overview
- Command: `npm test --silent`
- Environment: containerized Linux runner with Node.js 20 executing the Node smoke harness
- Trigger: Regression verification requested via follow-up review feedback

## Results
The Node smoke harness passed in **0.4 seconds**. The run exercised the following checks:

| # | Scenario | What it verifies |
| - | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | App mount point present | Confirms `index.html` still exposes the `#app` container needed by the React bootstrap. |
| 2 | Generator API exported | Ensures `window.capyGenerator` remains available for scripted/manual interactions. |
| 3 | Handbook test guidance present | Verifies `AGENTS.md` continues to publish the Test Results section for contributors. |

## Raw output
```
✓ index.html exposes the app mount point
✓ window.capyGenerator API remains documented in index.html
✓ Agent handbook records the test results section

All tests passed.
```
