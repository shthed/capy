# Test Run - 2025-10-04

## Overview
- Command: `npm test --silent`
- Environment: containerized Linux runner with Node.js 20 and bundled Playwright deps
- Trigger: Regression verification requested via follow-up review feedback

## Results
All Playwright smoke and SVG quality suites passed in **29.1 seconds**. The run covered the
following scenarios (the UI review capture now also records HUD progress text, the ARIA label, and art-library visibility in its JSON summary):

| # | Scenario | What it verifies |
| - | -------- | ---------------- |
| 1 | Application shell renders | React runtime boots, starter artwork mounts, and HUD chrome appears. |
| 2 | Artwork and palette presence | Bundled SVG scene and swatch dock render with expected DOM structure. |
| 3 | Art library listing | The library dialog opens, lists all starter scenes, and supports navigation. |
| 4 | Painting updates progress | Filling a cell adjusts the completion meter and progress chip. |
| 5 | Starter merge behavior | Loader merges bundled starters with any stored scenes on boot. |
| 6 | Title preservation | Stored artwork titles remain intact after a merge refresh. |
| 7 | Lagoon SVG quality | `capybara-lagoon.svg` parses without errors and meets quality checks. |
| 8 | Twilight SVG quality | `capybara-twilight.svg` passes parser and quality validation. |
| 9 | Forest SVG quality | `lush-green-forest.svg` passes parser and quality validation. |
