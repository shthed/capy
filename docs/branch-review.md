# Branch Review: `work` vs `f7af674`

## Merge compatibility check
- Created a temporary branch at commit `f7af674` (latest known `main`) and ran `git merge work --no-commit --no-ff` to simulate merging this branch.
- Git reported "Automatic merge went well" with no conflicts, indicating the branch currently merges cleanly into the recorded `main` snapshot.

## Features present on `work` that are not in `f7af674`
- **Capybara Springs defaults.** The bundled Capybara Springs lagoon illustration auto-loads on startup, includes reload controls, and now exposes low/medium/high detail presets that swap colour and region counts before regenerating the puzzle.
- **Enhanced painting feedback.** Filled regions reveal their underlying artwork, swatch selections flash matching regions, and the help modal logs fills, ignored taps, sample reloads, zooms, and other actions for easier QA.
- **Viewport & control refinements.** The canvas now recentres after device rotation, supports mouse wheel, pinch, and +/- zoom shortcuts, enables fullscreen toggling, and keeps interface zoom suppressed on mobile while offering a GUI scale slider.
- **Presentation controls.** Players can pick a custom background colour that saves with autosaves/exports, collapse advanced generator options (including the prompt), and access the new Appearance section in Settings.
- **Documentation & assets.** README, gameplay session logs, UI review notes, and the bundled capybara SVG/map have been expanded to describe the richer sample scene, new commands, and updated regression tests.


## Git update status
- Ran `git fetch --all --prune` to refresh local refs before auditing the branch.
- Confirmed `git status` reports a clean working tree on `work`, indicating no pending merges or conflicts after the update.
- Verified both `main` and `work` point at commit `ebd610a` after the merge rehearsal by inspecting `git branch -vv`.

## Merge execution
- Created local `main` at commit `f7af674` and fast-forwarded it to the current `work` head (`ebd610a`) with `git merge work`.
- Switched back to `work` and confirmed `git status` remains clean on both branches, confirming the merge completed without additional edits.
