## Pull Requests With Merge Conflicts

### ⚠️ PR #56: Streamline palette scrolling and progress messaging
- **Status:** HAS MERGE CONFLICTS
- **Branch:** `codex/resolve-merge-conflicts` → `codex/fix-screen-size-and-zoom-issues-8qpebx`
- **Mergeable:** ❌ No (`mergeable_state: "dirty"`)
- **Files changed:** 1 file (docs/merge-conflict-report.md)
- **Changes:** +22 lines, -23 lines

**Issue:**
This PR is trying to merge into a branch (`codex/fix-screen-size-and-zoom-issues-8qpebx`) rather than `main`. The base branch may have diverged significantly from the current state of `main`, causing merge conflicts.

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Rebase onto main:** The author should rebase this branch onto the current `main` branch instead of the old feature branch
2. **Resolve conflicts:** After rebasing, any remaining conflicts should be manually resolved
3. **Update base branch:** Consider changing the base branch to `main` directly
4. **Review purpose:** This appears to be a documentation-only change updating merge conflict reports - verify if it's still relevant

## Technical Details

### PR #56 Merge Conflict Details
The merge conflict in PR #56 occurs because:
- **Base branch:** `codex/fix-screen-size-and-zoom-issues-8qpebx` (feature branch)
- **File affected:** `docs/merge-conflict-report.md`
- **Issue:** The base branch has diverged from main and the documentation file has been updated independently

# Fetch latest from main
git fetch origin main

# Rebase onto main instead of the old feature branch
git rebase origin/main

# Resolve any conflicts in docs/merge-conflict-report.md
# The file should describe resolved merge conflicts, so check if content is still relevant

# Then update the PR base branch in GitHub UI to target main instead
```
