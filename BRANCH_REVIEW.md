# Branch Review Summary

## Remote Synchronization
- Added the canonical GitHub repository as `origin` (`https://github.com/shthed/capy.git`).
- Fetched the new remote to surface upstream refs (`git fetch origin`).
- Remote branches now available locally:
  - `origin/main`
  - `origin/codex/resolve-merge-conflicts`
  - `origin/vscode-lagoon`

## Branch Inventory
- `work`: Current default branch containing the latest merged feature work from prior pull requests.
- `origin/main`: Upstream default branch mirroring the repository on GitHub.
- `origin/codex/resolve-merge-conflicts`: Historical branch used to resolve earlier merge conflicts.
- `origin/vscode-lagoon`: Source branch for the lagoon feature set (now merged into `work`).

## History Review
- `work` now leads with merge commit `b73178e`, which reconciles `origin/vscode-lagoon` after resolving conflict markers in the lagoon assets, docs, and vendor bundles.
- Recent history shows merged pull requests consolidating SVG import improvements (`208576a`), segmentation adjustments (`cffa377`), automated SVG checks (`55eb07b`), starter loading refinements (`6e609fe`, `3229819`), and the lagoon conflict-resolution merge itself.
- No divergent local branches or unfinished feature branches are present.

## Merge Plan
1. With `origin/vscode-lagoon` merged, verify `work` remains ahead of `origin/main` (`git log origin/main..work`).
2. Fast-forward the target branch (`git checkout <target> && git merge --ff-only work`) once remote pushes are allowed; otherwise, prepare a pull request from `work` summarizing the conflict resolution.
