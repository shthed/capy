# Maintainer Quick Start Guide

## TL;DR

**3 PRs need conflict resolution. 4 branches can be deleted.**

Execute these commands (requires repository write access):

```bash
# Step 1: Delete stale branches (30 seconds)
git push origin --delete \
  codex/add-local-storage-auto-reload-for-drawings \
  codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-mdptn5 \
  codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html \
  codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html-nzppqn

# Step 2: Resolve PR #31 (5 minutes)
git fetch --all
git checkout codex/implement-image-generation-on-game-load
git merge origin/main
# Follow: PR31_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_EXAMPLE.md
git commit && git push origin codex/implement-image-generation-on-game-load

# Step 3: Resolve PR #30 (5 minutes)
git checkout codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-wkhe6x
git merge origin/main
# Similar strategy to PR #31
git commit && git push origin codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-wkhe6x

# Step 4: Resolve PR #25 (5 minutes)
git checkout codex/run-tests-on-app-functions
git merge origin/main
# Similar strategy to PR #31
git commit && git push origin codex/run-tests-on-app-functions

# Step 5: Verify (2 minutes)
npm test --silent
```

**Total time:** ~20 minutes

## What Happened?

Main branch has evolved since these PRs were created. They now have conflicts because:

- **Main added:** Autosave, cloud sync, GitHub Actions
- **PRs added:** ChatGPT integration, detail presets, palette improvements

All features are compatible - just need to merge them together.

## Quick Reference

### Documentation Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` | Complete analysis & action items |
| `MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` | Detailed resolution strategies |
| `PR31_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_EXAMPLE.md` | Concrete before/after examples for PR #31 |
| `MAINTAINER_QUICK_START.md` | This file |

### Branches to Delete

✅ Safe to delete (already merged):
- `codex/add-local-storage-auto-reload-for-drawings` (PR #29)
- `codex/run-tests-on-app-functions-mdptn5` (PR #26)
- `codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html` (PR #27)
- `codex/update-touch-pointer-handling-in-index.html-nzppqn` (PR #28)

### PRs with Conflicts

❌ Need resolution:
- **PR #31** - Most recent, highest priority
- **PR #30** - Medium priority
- **PR #25** - Oldest, lowest priority

## Resolution Strategy (All PRs)

**Key principle:** Keep ALL features (additive merge, no deletions)

### For Each Conflicting File:

1. **Storage/Constants** → Keep both sets
2. **Initialization** → Call all functions
3. **Features** → List all features
4. **Documentation** → Merge narratives

### Common Pattern:

```javascript
// ❌ DON'T: Choose one
const FEATURE_A_KEY = "...";  // OR  const FEATURE_B_KEY = "...";

// ✅ DO: Keep both
const FEATURE_A_KEY = "...";
const FEATURE_B_KEY = "...";
```

## Conflict Files (All PRs)

Each PR has conflicts in:
- `README.md` - Features list, how-it-works section
- `docs/gameplay-session.md` - Actions, observations
- `index.html` - Constants, initialization, boot sequence

## After Resolution

1. Check GitHub - PRs should show green "mergeable" status
2. Run tests: `npm test --silent`
3. Merge PRs in order: #31 → #30 → #25

## If You Get Stuck

1. Read `PR31_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION_EXAMPLE.md` - concrete examples
2. Read `MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` - detailed strategies
3. Read `BRANCH_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - full context

## Automated Script (Optional)

If you want to automate the resolution, adapt the script in `MERGE_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md`. It needs manual conflict resolution logic added, but provides the structure.

## Questions?

- All conflicts are additive (combining features, not replacing)
- No existing functionality is removed
- Features are compatible (verified by analysis)
- Tests should pass after resolution
