# Progress Review

## Overview
The renderer refactor outlined in the latest brief has not been started in this branch. The codebase still contains the original 2D canvas implementation without the abstraction layer or WebGL scaffolding.

## Key Outstanding Items
- Introduce a renderer interface to coordinate the existing 2D drawing flow with an eventual WebGL backend.
- Extend the render cache so region geometries provide GPU-ready buffers alongside the current Path2D data.
- Implement WebGL initialization, shaders, and the offscreen framebuffer required for region hit-testing.
- Update interaction logic so zooming/panning drive renderer matrices instead of CSS transforms, with a 2D fallback when WebGL is unavailable.
- Move number labels to an overlay (or WebGL text) renderer and cover zoom edge cases with automated tests.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Land the renderer abstraction while keeping the current Canvas 2D path intact.
2. Add the geometry triangulation helper near the render cache utilities to prepare buffers for WebGL draws.
3. Stand up a minimal WebGL renderer that can draw fills/outlines before layering on hit-testing and overlays.
4. Replace CSS-based zoom with renderer-managed transforms and ensure the 2D fallback remains pixel-perfect.
5. Port number labels to the overlay canvas and update the Playwright suite to guard against outline regression.

No code paths have been modified yet, so functionality remains identical to the prior release.
