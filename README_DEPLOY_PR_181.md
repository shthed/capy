## What Gets Fixed

### Files Updated
1. `.github/workflows/deploy-branch.yml` - Updated to use Node.js scripts
2. `scripts/build-pages-site.mjs` - **NEW** - Builds README HTML
3. `scripts/generate_readme_html.py` - **NEW** - README conversion fallback
4. `scripts/render-branch-page.mjs` - **NEW** - Renders branch page
5. `scripts/update-deployments.mjs` - **NEW** - Updates deployment metadata

### Key Changes
- Adds `steps.sync.outputs.preview_url` fallback in workflow
- Implements active branch manifest cleanup
- Uses modular Node.js scripts instead of inline bash/python
- Adds PR branch tracking to commit metadata
- Implements proper error handling in deployment pipeline

## After Deployment

### Monitor Progress
1. **Workflow Runs:** https://github.com/shthed/capy/actions
2. Look for new run on `codex/refactor-canvas-rendering-to-use-controller`
3. Should complete successfully in ~1-2 minutes

### Access Deployed Site
**Preview URL:** https://shthed.github.io/capy/codex-refactor-canvas-rendering-to-use-controller/

### Verify Deployment
- Check that the URL loads the puzzle generator
